## Lab - 1
- Open book - you can use any resource
### Programming Fundamentals:
#### Most of the programs from questions 1-7 can be written inside the main method or other static methods without having to use OOP concepts
1. Write a program to reverse the order of words in a sentence
> This question involves String concepts. 
- You can write a static method that takes a String and returns a String which is the words in reverse order of the parameter String. 
- Ask the user to input a sentence, send it to the static method, print the return value 
- Use your palindrome assignment for reference if needed
Sample Output: 
```
Enter a sentence and the words will be printed in reverse order
The first program everyone writes is Hello World
Sentence reversed: World Hello is writes everyone program first The 
```
2. Write a program to ask the user for a score and display their grade based on lab 1 - condtional statements.png image
>This question invloves if-else if-else statements
Sample Output:

3. Write a program to ask the user to enter a year and tell them if it's a leap year or not
- A leap year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, OR it is dividible by 400
- HINT: % operator can be used to check if a number is divisible by another number. If the number is divisible % will be equal to 0
>This question involves logical operators and boolean variable
Sample output:

4. Write a program to run a forever while loop starting at count = 1, increment count with every iteration. break the loop when count is 5. continue the loop without printing the number when count is 3.
>This question involves while loop, break and continue statements

Sample output:

5. Write a program to initialize an array of 5 float numbers. Loop through the array using a for loop and print each number.
>This question involves array (which can hold primitive and is of fixed size) and for loops 
-Your code can be written inside the main method
Sample output:

6. Write a program to ask the user for a decimal number, and print the floor, ceil, round of that number
>This question involves java.lang.Math class

Sample Output:

7. Write a program to ask the user for states they have visited in the US. Ignore duplicate inputs. The program runs forever until the user types "done". When the user types "done", display the unique list of cities back to the user.

Sample Output:

### OOP Concepts:
#### These questions would involve following basic OOP principles and coding principles like single-responsibility, DRY and YAGNI principles. Each entity will be created in it's own class. main method will be in a seperate class and that'll be the one interacting with the user.

8. Write a
